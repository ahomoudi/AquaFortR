It allows users to integrate compiled code without using complex application programming interfaces (APIs), such as the C API of R. Moreover, dotCall64 supports long vectors having more than 231−1 elements and implements a mechanism to avoid unnecessary copies of R objects. Therefore, dotCall64 facilitates making existing C, C++, and Fortran libraries accessible for R and is particularly useful for applications involving long vectors.}
